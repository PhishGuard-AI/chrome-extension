# PhishGuard AI

## Overview

**PhishGuard AI** is an AI-powered Chrome extension designed to detect phishing URLs and safeguard users from malicious websites. The extension uses a combination of rule-based detection (URL length, domain entropy, HTTP vs. HTTPS) and machine learning to classify URLs as safe or potentially harmful.

## Features

- **Phishing URL Detection**: Identifies phishing attempts based on URL length, domain entropy, suspicious keywords, and insecure HTTP connections.
- **AI-Based Risk Scoring**: Provides a risk score for every URL, helping users assess the danger level of visited websites.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly in the browser to offer real-time protection while you browse.
